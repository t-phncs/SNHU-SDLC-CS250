  <h3>User Stories</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Identify at least five user requests or requirements based on the user interactions in the animation. These should be written in the following format: As a <type of user> I want to <perform some task> so that I can <achieve some goal>.</li>
   <li>Next, identify the user requests or requirements as large, medium, or small and prioritize them according to your perceived user needs. Then place these requirements into the Product Backlog, which is the first sheet in the CS 250 Module Three User Stories Assignment Template Word Document. Put your requirements in order so that the highest priority item is first on the list and the lowest priority item is at the end.</li>
   <li>Review the User Story Details Example, which is the second sheet in the template. Then select one large requirement, one medium requirement, and one small requirement from your Product Backlog. Write a detailed user story for each requirement using the User Story Details sheets in the template.</li>

       <li>How might you go about getting this additional information?</li>
       <li>Create a sample email that would effectively relate your needs and prompt a proper response. Be sure to identify the recipient of the communication and the specific information you expect to receive.</li>

       <li>What is an example of a communication practice from this course that helped your team complete their work? Consider an example from the SNHU Travel assignments or from the group discussions.</li>
       <li>What is one way that an agile project-management tool (such as JIRA, Azure Boards, or RTC) can help coordinate and increase efficiency within the team? Be sure to consider a tool and not a Scrum event.</li>

       <li>Describe how a Scrum-agile approach supported project completion when the project was interrupted and changed direction. Be sure to use specific examples from your experiences.</li>
       <li>Demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively with your team by providing samples of your communication. Be sure to explain why your examples were effective in their context and how they encouraged collaboration among team members.</li>
       <li>Evaluate the organizational tools and Scrum-agile principles that helped your team be successful. Be sure to reference the Scrum events in relation to the effectiveness of the tools.
